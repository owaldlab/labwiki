## Lab Duties


**Is it your turn?**
1. **Clean surfaces** of main lab with 80% ethanol.
2. Prepare fresh **fly traps** for all the fly rooms and throw away the old ones.
3. Replace the **waste disposal bags** on the benches of the lab if necessary and throw the full ones to the S1 bin. If the S1 bin is almost full and needs to be replaced, please let Andrea know. If the glass yellow bin is full, close it and throw it in the black bin outside the CCO (medical garbage) and get an empty yellow bin from the preparation room.
4. Refill **empty boxes** with new pipette tips and give it to Andrea for autoclaving.
5. Test the **eye shower** from the old and new lab by letting the water run in the sink for 5 minutes. Write down your name in the sheet for the eye shower test in the corresponding date.
6. Clean the surface under the **hood** and replace the disposal bag. (close the bag with a tape and throw it in the white chemical waste ton.)
7. Close the big red bag with **fly trash**, write the date on it and bring it to the freezer upstairs. 
8. Check the **stock boxes**. Please check 10x vials/box, they still look ok.

* If you cannot make your turn, find a replacement in advance! And if you have some questions ask **Caro**.
